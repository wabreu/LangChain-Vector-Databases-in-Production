    "text_all = \"\"\" Altman highlighted the potential benefits of AI technologies like ChatGPT and Dall-E 2 to help address significant challenges such as climate change and cancer, but he also stressed the need to mitigate the risks associated with increasingly powerful AI models. Altman proposed that governments consider implementing licensing and testing requirements for AI models that surpass a certain threshold of capabilities. He highlighted OpenAI’s commitment to safety and extensive testing before releasing any new systems, emphasising the company’s belief that ensuring the safety of AI is crucial. Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal expressed their recognition of the transformative nature of AI and the need to understand its implications for elections, jobs, and security. Blumenthal played an audio introduction using an AI voice cloning software trained on his speeches, demonstrating the potential of the technology. Blumenthal raised concerns about various risks associated with AI, including deepfakes, weaponised disinformation, discrimination, harassment, and impersonation fraud. He also emphasised the potential displacement of workers in the face of a new industrial revolution driven by AI.\"\"\"\n",
