    "    \"What is PayPal?\\nPayPal is a digital wallet that follows you wherever you go. Pay any way you want. Link your credit cards to your PayPal Digital wallet, and when you want to pay, simply log in with your username and password and pick which one you want to use.\",\n",
    "    \"Why should I use PayPal?\\nIt's Fast! We will help you pay in just a few clicks. Enter your email address and password, and you're pretty much done! It's Simple! There's no need to run around searching for your wallet. Better yet, you don't need to type in your financial details again and again when making a purchase online. We make it simple for you to pay with just your email address and password.\",\n",
    "    \"Is it secure?\\nPayPal is the safer way to pay because we keep your financial information private. It isn't shared with anyone else when you shop, so you don't have to worry about paying businesses and people you don't know. On top of that, we've got your back. If your eligible purchase doesn't arrive or doesn't match its description, we will refund you the full purchase price plus shipping costs with PayPal's Buyer Protection program.\",\n",
    "    \"Where can I use PayPal?\\nThere are millions of places you can use PayPal worldwide. In addition to online stores, there are many charities that use PayPal to raise money. Find a list of charities you can donate to here. Additionally, you can send funds internationally to anyone almost anywhere in the world with PayPal. All you need is their email address. Sending payments abroad has never been easier.\",\n",
    "    \"Do I need a balance in my account to use it?\\nYou do not need to have any balance in your account to use PayPal. Similar to a physical wallet, when you are making a purchase, you can choose to pay for your items with any of the credit cards that are attached to your account. There is no need to pre-fund your account.\"\n",
